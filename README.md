# H1-B-Data-analysis-Using-Hadoop
## The H1B is an employment-based, non-immigrant visa category for temporary foreign workers in the United States. For a foreign national to apply for H1B visa, an US employer must offer a job and petition for H1B visa with the US immigration department. This is the most common visa status applied for and held by international students once they complete college/ higher education (Masters, Ph.D.) and work in a full-time position. We will be performing analysis on the H1B visa applicants between the years 2011-2016.
## The main objective of this project is to demonstrate by using Hadoop concepts, how data generated from datasets can be mined and utilized to make targeted, real time and informed decisions.
